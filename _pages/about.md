Hello, I'm Namkyeong Lee.
I'm a Ph.D. student in the Industrial and Systems Department at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).
I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

During my doctoral studies, I worked as a research intern at Naver Corporation and Genentech, and also held the position of visiting scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was mentored by [Prof. Jimeng Sun](http://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/jimeng).

Nowadays, AI is revolutionizing practices across multiple domains. 
My interest lies in leveraging AI's potential to assimilate and utilize the vast expanse of human knowledge in different scientific disciplines, particularly in the areas of biology, chemistry, and more, ultimately benefiting human society.

My research topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for scientific discovery
- Large Language Models (LMMs) for scientific discovery
- Multi-modal Learning for scientific discovery
